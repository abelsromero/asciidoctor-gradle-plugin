docExtensions:: {groovy-dsl-name} and project-based extensions.
Use `docExtensions` to add one or more extensions. Use `setDocExtensions` to replace the current set of
extensions with a new set. Extensions can be any kind of object that is serialisable, although in most cases
they will be strings or files. If extensions are detached dependencies, they will not be serialised, but
rather will be placed on the classpath in order that {asciidoctorj-name} can pick them up automatically.
See xref:page$asciidoctorj-custom-extensions.adoc[] for more details.
fatalWarnings:: Patterns for {asciidoctorj-name} log messages that should be treated as fatal errors.
The list is empty be default. Use `setFatalWarnings` to clear any existing patterns or to decouple a task's
configuration from the global configuration. Use `fatalWarnings` to add more patterns.
Pass `missingIncludes()` to add the common use-case of missing include files.
gemPaths:: One or more gem installation directories (separated by the system path separator).
Use `gemPaths` to append. Use `setGemPaths` or `gemPaths=['path1','path2']` to overwrite.
Use `asGemPath` to obtain a path string, separated by platform-specific separator.
Type: `FileCollection`, but any collection of objects convertible with `project.files` can be passed
Default: empty
jrubyVersion:: Minimum version of JRuby to be used.
The exact version that will be used could be higher due to {asciidoctorj-name} having a transitive dependency
that is newer.
logLevel:: The log level at which AsciidoctorJ will log.
This is specified as a Gradle logging level. The plugin will translate it to the appropriate
{asciidoctorj-name} logging level. Default is whatever `project.logger.level` is at the time of execution.
modules:: Configuration for version of specific components and converters that can be used.
See xref:page$asciidoctorj-base-plugin.adoc#asciidoctorj-modules[] for which modules are supported.
options:: {asciidoctorj-name} options.
Use `options` to append and `setOptions` to replace any current options with a new set.
Options are evaluated as late as possible. See xref:page$asciidoctorj-base-plugin.adoc#options-and-attribues[Setting Options] for more details.
requires:: The set of Ruby modules to be included.
Use `requires` to append. Use `setRequires` or `requires=['name']` to overwrite.
Default: empty.
resolutionStrategy:: Strategies for resolving Asciidoctorj-related dependencies.
{asciidoctorj-name} dependencies are held in a detached configuration.
If for some special reason, you need to modify the way the dependency set is resolved, you can modify the
behaviour by adding one or more strategies.
onConfiguration:: Additional actions to be performed when the detached configuration for the
{asciidoctorj-name} is created.
version:: {asciidoctorj-name} version. If not specified a sane default version will be used.
